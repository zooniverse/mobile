# Zooniverse Mobile App
The Zooniverse Mobile app is a [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) app that allows folks like you and me to contribute to astronomy, ecology, and anthropology research from their couch, bathtub, or bus stop (but don't swipe and drive, please).

### Preparing The React Native Framework
#### Requirements:
 - Node >= 16 (Recommend >= 18)
#### Steps:
1. Follow the instructions for Android and iOS setup in [this guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).
2. Clone down this repo and navigate to its directory (called `mobile`).
3. Run `npm install` (later, if you need to reinstall dependencies for some reason, you can run `rm -rf node_modules/ && npm install`)
4. Run `npm start`.
#### Troubleshooting:
- [Troubleshooting wiki](https://github.com/zooniverse/mobile/wiki/Troubleshooting) for additional help

### iOS
#### Requirements:
 - XCode
 - An iPhone X Simulator, which you can run from XCode.
 - To run on an iOS device see [Running on device - iOS]https://reactnative.dev/docs/running-on-device?platform=ios
#### Steps:
On the command line, from the `mobile` directory, run:
1. `cd ios && rm -rf Podfile.lock && pod install && cd ..`. You may need to `brew install cocoapods` first.
2. `npm run ios`

### Android
#### Requirements:
 - Android Studio
 - You'll need at least one emulator.  To get one:
    *  Within Android Studio, open the "AVD Manager" -  in the toolbar click the icon with the purple device and small android (fourth from the right)
    *  Click 'Create Virtual Device' - bottom left-hand corner
    *  Create at least one using the latest Android Release.  I have a few different size and Android Release configurations
 - You can also use an Android device that is plugged into your computer. Run `adb devices` and confirm you see your device listed. If not use [Running on device - android]https://reactnative.dev/docs/running-on-device?platform=android for troubleshooting
 - Also you'll need a Gradle properties file outside the project for keeping secrets that aren't checked into source control. This should be in ~/.gradle/gradle.properties and contain the following:
```
MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_FILE=/path/to/your/keystore.jks
MYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS=android
MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD=android
MYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD=**you can find this in passbolt**
```

You will have to get the key _itself_ from an existing maintainer. We are looking for a way to securely store this so you can get it without worrying about corruption. You don't need it to build for debuggingâ€”only for release to the Play Store.
#### Steps:
1. To run in the emulator from the command line (you'll need device connected or emulator already running): `npm run android`. Shortly, your emulator should boot with the Zooniverse app on it.
    - You need to have either a device emulator open already or a physical device plugged into your computer. Otherwise, you'll need to run through Android Studio
    - If Android studio prompts you to update Gradle files, you should do it.
    - The command `react-native run-android` will install the build, but fail in launching the app due to a bug with the `react-native` script with having a separate `applicationId` for development builds.

## If you Work for The Zooniverse

You may also want to set up error reporting from your local copy of the application to our reporting service, Sentry. [Here are instructions on how to do that!](https://github.com/zooniverse/mobile/wiki/Enabling-Sentry-for-your-Local-Builds)

### Tools:
This project is setup with Reactotron. Learn more [here](https://github.com/infinitered/reactotron). Reactotron is useful for:
1. Inspecting network requestsl.
2. As an alternative for console.log (Separates the logs for each device/simulator being used).
In order to use with an android device/emulator you must run `adb reverse tcp:9090 tcp:9090` before running the project.

## Releasing

### Android
Notes: 
 - It used to be standard to build the Android project in Android Studio but the preferred way is now through the command line.
 - Google requires API 35 but this requires a higher version of gradle than what our current version of React Native provides. Until we upgrade RN, add this line to the gradle.properties before you build for release `android.aapt2FromMavenOverride=/Users/XXX/Library/Android/sdk/build-tools/35.0.0/aapt2` and update the XXX to correct directory. If you do not have 35.0.0 open Android Studio and download the SDK 35. This suggestion comes from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78678063/android-15-update-compilesdk-android-35-cause-an-error-res-table-type-type-e.

Steps:
1) Reach out to a developer to get the upload key and the key.properties file. 
2) Place both in the android/app folder. 
3) Run `npx react-native build-android --mode=release`
4) The file will be built to android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab.
5) Drag n drop the file into the "App bundles" in Google Play store where you would normally create the internal testing release.

### iOS
Note: Nothing has changed with the iOS release process, continue to build and archive via Xcode.
